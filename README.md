## Purpose

The Las Vegas K-9 Foundation is made up of three organizations in Las Vegas:
- Silver State Kennel Club
- The Las Vegas Valley Dog Obedience Club
- Gamblers Agility Club of Greater Las Vegas

They all share the same goal and needed online presence:
- Educate the public about their mission
- Accept donations securely and clearly
- Promote upcoming events and community outreach

This project allowed me to collaborate directly with the organization and build a meaningful website from scratch.

## Process & Tech Stack

For the design, I took a lot of inspiration from other non-profit organizations in the US. I then created and iterated through many drafts using Figma and shared them with the organization board. When I got approval with them on a design, I started development using React. I chose Vite and React since right now, they just needed a SPA. As I was developing, the donation page was giving me a little bit of trouble. I worked with the Stripe SDK to create a custom donation page, but since there was a deadline, I opted in for a Stripe hosted page. This is a future feature I will work on so the organization has a donation page that fits their branding. After deployment, the organization has hosted events and have raised more than $4000 in donations. 

- **Frontend**: React.js
