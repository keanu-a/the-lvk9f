              The Las Vegas K-9 Foundation (LV K-9 Foundation) is a local Las
              Vegas non-profit organization that provides a venue with
              facilities, equipment and associated services for local canine
              organizationsâ€™ sporting events, exhibitions, gatherings, and

              About the LV K-9 Foundation
            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg">
              The Las Vegas metropolitan area is home to a number of
              canine-oriented organizations, such as the Silver State Kennel
              Club, the Las Vegas Valley Dog Obedience Club and LV DICE. These
              are local organizations whose activities include AKC Conformation,
              Obedience, and Agility training and competitions and other canine
              events and sporting activities. There is a scarcity of available,
              affordable and appropriate venues for these local organizations to
              host their activities and events, making it increasingly difficult
              for them to function and thrive. The LV K-9 Foundation was founded
              by a group of canine enthusiasts from various fields of canine
              activities to address these needs by securing and managing a
              canine-specific facility for these local organizations to hold
              their events and activities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg">
              As a non-profit 501(c)(3), the LV K-9 Foundation will be funded by
              public donations, venue and equipment rentals, primarily to
              canine-specific organizations and individuals, in-venue event
              support services fees and fund-raising activities to support its
              operations and facility acquisition.

            <p className="text-sm h-full w-full sm:text-lg">
              The primary objective of the LV K-9 Foundation is to provide a
              venue suitable for canine educational, conformation, obedience,
              agility, rally, Meet the Breeds, Canine Good Citizen, Barn Hunt,
              and other canine related events and activities in the Las Vegas
              metropolitan area, which will be named the Las Vegas K-9
              Educational and Events Center. Initially, this venue will be
              property leased by the LV K-9 Foundation until sufficient funds
              have been raised and a suitable property has been located to
              purchase. This facility will be made available to the local
              organizations at reasonable and affordable rates, and the facility
              will also acquire the equipment and furnishings required for these
              events for rental by these organizations for their events and
              activities. Our primary objectives are:
