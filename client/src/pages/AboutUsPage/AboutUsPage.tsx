            The Las Vegas K-9 Foundation (LV K-9 Foundation) is a local Las
            Vegas non-profit organization that provides a venue with facilities,

          <h3>About the LV K-9 Foundation</h3>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg">
            The Las Vegas metropolitan area is home to a number of
            canine-oriented organizations, such as the Silver State Kennel Club,
            the Las Vegas Valley Dog Obedience Club and Gamblers Agility Club of
            Greater Las Vegas. These are local organizations whose activities
            include AKC Conformation, Obedience, and Agility training and
            competitions and other canine events and sporting activities. There
            is a scarcity of available, affordable and appropriate venues for
            these local organizations to host their activities and events,
            making it increasingly difficult for them to function and thrive.
            The LV K-9 Foundation was founded by a group of canine enthusiasts
            from various fields of canine activities to address these needs by
            securing and managing a canine-specific facility for these local
            organizations to hold their events and activities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg">
            As a non-profit 501(c)(3), the LV K-9 Foundation will be funded by
            public donations, venue and equipment rentals, primarily to
            canine-specific organizations and individuals, in-venue event
            support services fees and fund-raising activities to support its
            operations and facility acquisition.

          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg">
            The primary objective of the LV K-9 Foundation is to provide a venue
            suitable for canine educational, conformation, obedience, agility,
            rally, Meet the Breeds, Canine Good Citizen, Barn Hunt, and other
            canine related events and activities in the Las Vegas metropolitan
            area, which will be named the Las Vegas K-9 Educational and Events
            Center. Initially, this venue will be property leased by the LV K-9
            Foundation until sufficient funds have been raised and a suitable
            property has been located to purchase. This facility will be made
            available to the local organizations at reasonable and affordable
            rates, and the facility will also acquire the equipment and
            furnishings required for these events for rental by these
            organizations for their events and activities. Our primary
            objectives are:
