                The Las Vegas metropolitan area is home to a number of

              These are local organizations whose activities include AKC
              Conformation, Obedience, and Agility training and competitions and
              other canine events and sporting activities. There is a scarcity
              of available, affordable and appropriate venues for these local
              organizations to host their activities and events, making it
              increasingly difficult for them to function and thrive. The LV K-9
              Foundation was founded by a group of canine enthusiasts from
              various fields of canine activities to address these needs by
              securing and managing a canine-specific facility for these local
              organizations to hold their events and activities.

              canine-specific organizations and individuals, in-venue event
              support services fees and fund-raising activities to support its
              operations and facility acquisition.

              The primary objective of the LV K-9 Foundation is to provide a
              venue suitable for canine educational, conformation, obedience,
              agility, rally, Meet the Breeds, Canine Good Citizen, Barn Hunt,
              and other canine related events and activities in the Las Vegas
              metropolitan area, which will be named the Las Vegas K-9
              Educational and Events Center. Initially, this venue will be
              property leased by the LV K-9 Foundation until sufficient funds
              have been raised and a suitable property has been located to
              purchase. This facility will be made available to the local
              organizations at reasonable and affordable rates, and the facility
              will also acquire the equipment and furnishings required for these
              events for rental by these organizations for their events and
              activities.
